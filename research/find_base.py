"""chaomod: find where the running game keeps its Chao Garden save data in memory. READ-ONLY, writes nothing.

Run while the game is open and you are standing inside the Chao Garden (the game loads the Chao save then):
    python find_base.py

It scans the game's memory for the two eggshell records we found in the save file, then checks the Chao name
bytes (21 22 23 24 25 26 27 = "ABCDEFG" in the game's character table) and prints the drive record it finds.
If the in-memory data is laid out like the file, one hit will pass every check and we get a base address.
