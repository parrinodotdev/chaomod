"""chaomod: write bytes into the running game's in-memory Chao save (the image find_base.py located).

Usage (game open, standing in the Chao Garden):
    python mem_poke.py OFFSET HEXBYTES
Example (rename Chao slot 1 from ABCDEFG to BCDEFGH):
    python mem_poke.py 0x3AB6 22232425262728

OFFSET is a FILE offset: the game's memory copy mirrors the save file, so file offset N lives at base + N.
It finds the base the same way find_base.py does, shows the old bytes, writes, and reads back to verify.
Nothing touches the save file directly; the game writes its own file (with its own checksum) when you leave the garden.
